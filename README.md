Modus Angular Boilerplate
======
A version of the Modus NGBP that uses gulp instead of Grunt. Setup to follow Todd Motto and John Papa's styleguide for Angular.

### Get up and running

```shell
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp
```

A server will be started at `localhost:1337` for local dev. gulp will watch for changes to your filesystem, and run the appropriate tasks based on what changes.

### TODO
- [ ] add testing integration
- [ ] understanding if I'm using gulp properly
